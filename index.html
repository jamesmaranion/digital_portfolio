                    <p>Throughout my college life, we were one of the few batches that had plenty of free time
                        since the majority of that time was spent online. One thing I’ve learned is to go beyond
                        what we are being taught in class so I had to find a way to elevate my skills and meet new people, that's where 
                        I joined the Association of Information Management. It was still an online setting but I learned how to work with other people
                        in an organization where we are to aid students in elevating their careers. I elevated those skills further during our Project Management Subject
                        where I was apointed as the Programming Team Lead</p>

                    <p>Throughout my college life, we were one of the few batches that had plenty of free time
                        since the majority of that time was spent online. One thing I’ve learned is to go beyond
                        what we are being taught in class and it is one of the learnings I brought with me when I
                        started my internship program. Throughout the internship I was able to utilize my skills in
                        programming, problem solving, data analysis, and data engineering as well as some
                        math skills. Working as an intern elevated my experience, skills and has given me a new
                        perspective on a specific sub-group of the tech industry. </p>
                    <p class="mb-0">Moving forward I will have to commit
                        a life long learning numerous other things beyond my career as learning will never and should never 
                        stop after graduation.</p>
